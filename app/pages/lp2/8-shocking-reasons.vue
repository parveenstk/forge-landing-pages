                            <p>Social skills and gut health are <span class="extrablod"> more connected</span> than you
                                may realize.
                            </p>
                            <p>That’s because the gut produces chemicals that affect confidence and empathy.</p>

                            <p>A gut imbalance causes you to feel "off" in social settings without knowing <span
                                    class="extrablod">why.</span> You’re more sensitive to noise, crowds, or changes in
                                routine.</p>

                            <p>You’re not antisocial; it’s your <span class="extrablod">gut-brain axis</span> not
                                supporting emotional regulation. This is
                                especially true for kids.</p>

                            <p>The <span class="extrablod">good news</span> is once your gut health improves, things
                                change for the better.
                            </p>

                            <p>You’re <span class="extrablod">more outgoing</span> and confident. With kids, playdates are easier, and they’re <span class="extrablod">more resilient</span> in social situations.</p>

                                This is common after illness because antibiotics disrupt gut bacteria. It’s also common
