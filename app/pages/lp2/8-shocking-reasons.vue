                <p>You've tried everything to fix random meltdowns, mood swings, and brain fog. Supplements and
                    smoothies.
                    Pills and powdered drinks. Read all the opinions of “experts”. But nothing’s changed.</p>

                <p>>What if I told you a truth you never hear about:</p>

                <p class="extrablod">You can't feel good if your gut feels bad.</p>

                <p>Scientists have found that up to 90% of serotonin (your "happy hormone") comes from the gut, not the
                    brain. When you survive on processed foods and miss key nutrients, your gut health suffers. And your
                    mood pays the price.</p>

                <p>The result? You suffer from the blues and the blahs, with no motivation or focus. Your kids seem
                    "difficult" or “hard to handle”. Yet, it's an imbalanced gut everyone’s struggling with. It's what’s
                    fraying your nerves and ruining your kids’ emotional world.</p>

                            they're screaming over the wrong color cup. If it happens when they're hungry, you're

                        <p>Processed snacks and meals make those blood sugar crashes hit hard. But here's a secret:

                        <p>It’s about an unhealthy gut that can't regulate blood sugar well. Or produce the calming
                            neurotransmitters needed to handle frustration. The result? Explosive overreactions to minor

                            all
                            night. Poor gut health disrupts sleep quality. It leaves exhaustion and irritability even

                        <p>Combine that with a breakfast that’s sugary cereal or processed pastries? You get a blood

                        <p>What looks like stubbornness might really be anxiety. And gut health plays a huge role in
                            anxiety levels, especially in kids. The gut produces many of the same neurotransmitters as
                            the
                            brain. This includes GABA, which helps you feel calm and secure.</p>

                        <p>Having poor gut health means you can't produce enough calming chemicals. Everything feels
                            more
                            threatening. So clinging to familiar foods, routines, and environments is how to soothe the
                            anxiety.</p>

                        <p>It becomes a vicious cycle. Anxiety leads to pickiness, picky eating hurts gut health, poor
                            gut
                            health amps up anxiety. Breaking the cycle starts with healing the gut.</p>

                        <p>Before you worry about attention disorders, consider this: gut inflammation disrupts brain
                        function. When you eat too much processed food, you don’t get the right nutrients. Your gut
                        becomes inflamed. And that inflammation travels to the brain.</p>

                        <p>The result? You’re scatter-brained. Hyperactive. Unable to focus. And kids get it worse. But
                        unlike true ADHD, these symptoms fluctuate. It's all based on what you've eaten and how your gut
                        is functioning on any given day.</p>

                        <p>Many families report dramatic improvements once their gut health improves. Your focus at work or
                        in daily activities sharpens. The hyperactive kid now sits through dinner without bouncing off
                        the chair.</p>
