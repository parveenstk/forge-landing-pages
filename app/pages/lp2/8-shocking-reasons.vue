                            <p>Additionally, when you eat lots of sugar and artificial additives, your gut works
                                overtime to
                                process them. Even at bedtime. This creates internal "stress" that makes it hard to fall
                                asleep
                                and stay there.</p>
                            <p>Poor sleep then makes mood regulation even harder the next day. It's a cycle where gut

                            <p>Here’s the why:</p>

                            <p>Because an unhealthy gut can't produce enough <span class="extrablod">melatonin</span>
                                (the sleep hormone). </p>

                            <p>And even if it does, it can’t process it correctly.</p>

                            <p>Plus, when you eat lots of sugar and artificial additives, your gut works <span

                                    <p>Even at bedtime.
                            </p>
                            <p>This creates internal "stress" that leads to trouble falling asleep.</p>
                            <p>Or frequent wake-ups. Even nightmares.</p>

                            <p>And awful sleep makes it <span class="extrablod">even harder</span> to balance your moods
                                the next day. </p>
